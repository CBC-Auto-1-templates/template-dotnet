== Automation DSL Template for .NET

This is a boilerplate template to use as a basis for building .NET applications.

In this template we have a simple .NET Minimal api with Swagger Support.

To start the server, run the following commands:

1. Build application

    dotnet build

2. Start the webserver by running the command

    dotnet run

Once the server is started, navigate to http://localhost:50449 to view swagger UI page.
